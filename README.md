Getting Colder is a survival horror game that is made to “Cool you down” by activating
your fight or flight response. Have you ever played or watched something horrifying and
got chills down your spine? Well, the reason this happens is because horror makes you
anxious. When you are anxious, your body suffers from what is called “Anxiety chills”.
These chills are a result of your body directing blood flow away from your extremities
and into your vital organs, which is necessary in a survival situation. The name "Getting
Colder" is referring to the person you are controlling, who is trying to survive in a forest.
Throughout the game, the person you are controlling will continue to get colder and
colder until you do something about it (indicated by how bright the screen is). My game
is a great way for young adults and teenagers to fend off the heat during the hot
summer. All you need to play the game is a laptop. Laptops only use around 50-100
watts per hour when used. Meanwhile, air conditioners use an average of 3000 watts of
electricity. So not only will you stay cool, but you can also feel good about the fact that
you are saving tons of electricity.
